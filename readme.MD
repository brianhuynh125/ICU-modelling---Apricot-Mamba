## Key Benefits

### 1. **Enhanced Patient Risk Assessment**
- Incorporates multiple scoring mechanisms beyond traditional ICU risk scoring.
- Uses a **blended risk score** based on established clinical metrics such as **SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment)**.
- Aims to provide a more holistic and **trustworthy** risk evaluation for critical care patients.

### 2. **Improved ICU Resource Utilization**
- Calculates **real-time ICU bed occupancy rates**, ensuring efficient resource management.
- Helps **predict bed availability**, improving hospital operations and emergency response.
- Assists medical staff in making data-driven decisions about **patient admission and discharge planning**.

### 3. **Reduction in Alarm Fatigue**
- Introduces **smarter alert mechanisms** to minimize false alarms, preventing unnecessary stress for healthcare professionals.
- Uses **refined risk scores** to filter out low-priority alarms and only trigger alerts when intervention is genuinely required.
- Aims to **improve patient outcomes** by ensuring timely and accurate responses to critical conditions.

### 4. **Real-Time Monitoring & Decision Support**
- Enables hospitals to continuously monitor patient deterioration and risk levels.
- Offers **dashboard integration** for quick and effective decision-making.
- Supports seamless integration with **existing hospital management systems**.

## Current Development Status
- The system is **actively being developed and tested** to refine predictive accuracy and integration capabilities.
- Additional **data sources and clinical inputs** are being incorporated to improve the effectiveness of predictions.
- Work is in progress to make the solution **scalable and adaptable** to various hospital infrastructures.

## How This Project Will Help ICU Units
